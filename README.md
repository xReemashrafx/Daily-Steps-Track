# Daily-Steps-Tracker
The Daily Steps Tracker is a simple Python program that tracks and analyzes daily step counts for a week. It was created as part of the "Getting Started with Python" course to practice basic Python programming concepts.

The program calculates:
-Total steps taken in the week
-Average steps per day
-The highest and lowest step counts
-Number of days where the step goal is reached
-Goal achievement percentage

Features:
-Uses a Python dictionary to store steps for each day
-Loops through the data to perform calculations
-Tracks how many days meet or exceed the daily goal (default: 5000 steps)
-Displays all results in a clear format
